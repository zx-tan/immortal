# Project Name: Immortals

## Description
Immortals Tower Defense is an engaging and addictive strategy game available for iOS, Android, and PC platforms. In this game, players must defend their kingdom from hordes of enemy creatures by strategically placing defensive towers along the enemy's path.

As the ruler of a powerful kingdom, players will face waves of relentless enemies, ranging from goblins and trolls to powerful dragons and mythical beasts. The objective is to prevent the enemies from reaching and destroying the kingdom's central stronghold. To achieve this, players must strategically position various types of towers with different attack capabilities and upgrade them to withstand increasingly challenging enemy waves.

## Features
Tower Defense Gameplay: Immortals Tower Defense offers classic tower defense mechanics where players strategically place towers to eliminate enemies as they traverse through predetermined paths.

Diverse Towers: The game includes a wide variety of towers, each with unique attributes, such as archer towers for long-range attacks, mage towers for area-of-effect spells, and cannon towers for heavy damage. Players can strategically combine towers for effective defense.

Upgrade System: Players can enhance their towers by upgrading them with various power-ups and abilities. Upgrades improve tower damage, attack speed, range, and unlock special abilities to handle tougher enemies.

Challenging Enemies: Face a range of challenging enemy types, each with different strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. From weak and fast-moving enemies to heavily armored foes and even boss battles, players will need to adapt their tower placement and strategies accordingly.

Strategic Map Design: The game features intricately designed maps with multiple paths and environmental obstacles. Players must analyze each map's layout and plan their tower placement strategically to create effective defense lines.

Resource Management: Players earn resources by defeating enemies, which can be used to build and upgrade towers. Wise resource management is crucial for maintaining a strong defense against increasingly powerful enemy waves.

Power-Ups and Abilities: Unlock and utilize powerful temporary power-ups and abilities to turn the tide of battle in your favor. These include area-of-effect attacks, freeze spells, and more.

Progressive Difficulty: As players advance through the game, the difficulty increases, presenting more challenging enemy waves and requiring the use of advanced strategies and tower combinations.
